# FileOrganiser
A small utility to organise files into folders according to Year > Month

## Why I made this
I save all my photos from my DSLR, smartphone and my wifes smartphone.  This ends up with a tonne of image/video files that I like to organise by their date.  So instead of doing it manually, I created this app to to move/copy the files into a sensible folder structure, such as:

2018
-> January
-> February
-> March
etc.

## How to use it
Select the folder with the files inside that you wish to organise, (It's a recursive search meaning *every* file underneath that folder (including subfolders) will be actioned) and choose your mode (Year or Year > Month) and transfer type (Move / Copy).  Click Go and watch your files be auto-magically organised into folders.

There is no malicious code in here but I accept no responsibility for any damanages this app may make to your machine.

## Compiling
Using Visual Studio, load the solution and click start. You can publish the app from there too.
